# Defensive Security Projects: Blue Team Labs in Microsoft Azure & M365

## üîç Overview

This repository presents a collection of real-world defensive security labs using Microsoft‚Äôs cloud-native technologies. Each lab simulates common blue team and SOC tasks, such as securing infrastructure, monitoring cloud environments, automating incident response, and investigating threats.

All labs were completed in the **East US Azure region** using a mix of **Microsoft 365 Defender E5 and **Azure Pay-As-You-Go** resources.

## üìÅ Included Labs

### ‚úÖ Microsoft Defender for Endpoint
- Applied preset security policies (Safe Links, Anti-Malware, Anti-Phishing)
- Onboarded and monitored Windows devices
- Investigated threats using Security Copilot
- Created and executed KQL queries for hunting
- Enabled audit logging with Microsoft Purview

---

### ‚úÖ azure security and access control
- Built secure network architecture using NSGs and ASGs
- Controlled access using RBAC for multiple roles
- Configured Azure Firewall with DNS and route tables
- Restricted storage access using service endpoints and NSGs

---

### ‚úÖ Monitoring and Analytics
- Set up Log Analytics Workspaces and Data Collection Rules (DCRs)
- Monitored VM performance using Azure Monitor
- Enabled Defender for SQL with data classification
- Configured auditing at server and database levels

---

### ‚úÖ Azure SIEM & SOAR Automation
- Connected Azure Activity logs to Microsoft Sentinel
- Created analytics rules to detect Defender and CloudShell abuse
- Automated incident response with Logic Apps and playbooks
- Enabled and tuned UEBA anomaly detection
- Tested incident generation, alert grouping, and automated ownership

---

## üß† Skills Demonstrated

- Threat detection and hunting with KQL
- SIEM rule creation and playbook automation (Sentinel & Logic Apps)
- Endpoint protection and network segmentation
- Data classification and cloud audit configuration
- Role-based access and workload isolation
- Real-world alert triage and response workflows

## üí° Notes

- All resources were deployed, validated, and deleted to maintain cost control.
- Labs were repeated multiple times to build consistency and command-line fluency.
- Project structure allows for expansion with custom detections, honeypots, or Sentinel integrations.

---

## üöÄ Next Steps

- Integrate Microsoft Defender with Sentinel via custom connectors
- Build a hybrid honeypot lab using Defender XDR and Azure VM analytics
- Expand SOAR automation with playbook chaining and adaptive responses
- Develop custom anomaly rules and test behavioral detection scenarios
