# 🛡️ Microsoft 365 Defender, Security Copilot & Threat Response Simulation

This project simulates end-to-end security operations using Microsoft 365 Defender, Security Copilot, Microsoft Purview, and Defender for Endpoint. It covers threat policy configuration, incident response, role-based access, audit tracking, and compliance standards.

## 🔧 Lab Tasks

### ✅ 1. Defender for Office 365 & XDR Setup
- Enabled **Standard** and **Strict** preset protection policies:
  - Anti-phishing, anti-malware, anti-spam
  - Safe Links and Safe Attachments
- Defender XDR workspace was initialized successfully
- Device discovery was enabled to detect unmanaged endpoints
