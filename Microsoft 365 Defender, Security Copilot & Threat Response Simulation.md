# üõ°Ô∏è Microsoft 365 Defender, Security Copilot & Threat Response Simulation

This project simulates end-to-end security operations using Microsoft 365 Defender, Security Copilot, Microsoft Purview, and Defender for Endpoint. It covers threat policy configuration, incident response, role-based access, audit tracking, and compliance standards.
